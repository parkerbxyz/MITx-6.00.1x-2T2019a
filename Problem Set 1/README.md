# Problem Set 1

Week 1: Python Basics / Problem Set 1

## Problem 1

Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string `s`. Valid vowels are: '`a`', '`e`', '`i`', '`o`', and '`u`'. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, your program should print:

```markdown
Number of vowels: 5
```

## Problem 2

Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the number of times the string `'bob'` occurs in `s`.

For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, then your program should print

```markdown
Number of times bob occurs is: 2
```

## Problem 3

Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of `s` in which the letters occur in alphabetical order.

For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, then your program should print

```markdown
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
```

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

```markdown
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
```
