# Week 1 Exercises

Week 1: Python Basics / Finger Exercises

## Exercise: hello world

Write a piece of Python code that prints out the string `hello world`

---

**My solution:** [hello_world.py](hello_world.py)

## Exercise: happy

Write a piece of Python code that prints out the string '`hello world`' if the value of an integer variable, `happy`, is strictly greater than 2.

---

**My solution:** [happy.py](happy.py)

## Exercise: vara varb

Assume that two variables, `varA` and `varB`, are assigned values, either numbers or strings.

Write a piece of Python code that evaluates `varA` and `varB`, and then prints out one of the following messages:

- `"string involved"` if either `varA` or `varB` are strings
- `"bigger"` if `varA` is larger than `varB`
- `"equal"` if `varA` is equal to `varB`
- `"smaller"` if `varA` is smaller than `varB`

---

**My solution:** [vara_varb.py](vara_varb.py)

## Exercise: while

In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some while loops.

1. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

    prints `2`

    prints `4`

    prints `6`

    prints `8`

    prints `10`

    prints `Goodbye!`

2. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

    prints `Hello!`

    prints `10`

    prints `8`

    prints `6`

    prints `4`

    prints `2`

3. Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through `end`, inclusive. `end` is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define `end` to be 6, your code should print out the result:

``` markdown
21
```

which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

---

**My solution:** [while.py](while.py)

## Exercise: for

In this problem you'll be given a chance to practice writing some for loops.

1. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

    prints `2`

    prints `4`

    prints `6`

    prints `8`

    prints `10`

    prints `Goodbye!`

2. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

    prints `Hello!`

    prints `10`

    prints `8`

    prints `6`

    prints `4`

    prints `2`

3. Write a for loop that sums the values 1 through `end`, inclusive. `end` is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define `end` to be 6, your code should print out the result:

``` markdown
21
```

which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

**My solution:** [for.py](for.py)
